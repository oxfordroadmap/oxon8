Decarbonization requires voluntary will and participation, and values provide incentives. 

Only by providing true values to individuals and organizations, the climate goal of GHG emission reduction can be achieved.  It requires the incorporation of GHG and carbon emission information into the production, distribution, consumption and investment processes of human activities.  

The **dual-carbon management and service platforms** (carbon peak and carbon neutral)，or simply smart digital platforms of carbon and GHG emission data platforms, aims to introduce such information into the operations and management of enterprises and government organizations at various levels.  They embodies the main task of the "twin transition" or green digital transformation of human activities and interactions with the planet.  

How might we define, design and develop such a platform？

This project (visCEADs, or visualization of the Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets) utilizes the following resources released by various organizations.  They provide vital information and best practices for industries and government bodies to achieve "precision decarbonization," by which Oxford Roadmapping means the viable and actionable actions for GHG reduction based on science-based data：

* China's [　“Dual-Carbon Management Digital Platform”　Industry Standard](https://www.isc.org.cn//profile//2023/06/13/60cbc996-47cc-45be-bf0d-06053fbe57de.pdf) 
* China-led international collaboration research network [Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs)](https://www.ceads.net.cn/)
* The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies (ICTs) recommendations on green digital transformation standards:  [L.1470](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-L.1470-202001-I/en) [L.1480](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-L.1480-202212-I)
* Oxford Roadmapping's [ platform business model design for smart digital platforms of carbon neutral management and services ](https://oxon8.netlify.app/post/2023-02-20-smart-digital-platforms-carbon-neutral-management-services/)(developed based on the above standard and data resources)

# <i class="ai ai-figshare ai-1x fa-spin"></i>visCEADs: Visualizing the Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs) for Emission Insights into Industrial Inputs and Outputs

</div>

Developed by Oxford Roadmapping (Oxon8), the visCEADs project has systematically incorporates the core Chinese dataset of the [Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs)](https://www.ceads.net.cn/).  For building viable prototypes, the visCEADs project has applied data science for data cleaning and transformation, followed human-centered computing design of network visualization, and considered the standard requirements of China's [“Dual-Carbon Management Digital Platform”](https://www.isc.org.cn//profile//2023/06/13/60cbc996-47cc-45be-bf0d-06053fbe57de.pdf) and [platform business models](https://oxon8.netlify.app/post/2023-02-20-smart-digital-platforms-carbon-neutral-management-services/).

This prototype demonstrates one viable systematic approach in incorporating carbon emission and industrial input-output data at various junctures of operations and management across all industrial sectors, ranging from production to consumption.  It embodies the potential of integration of system engineering and system innovations. With the purpose to encourage scientific and value-added emission reduction efforts, such innovations highlight the science-based on one hand, and the value-added (and thus market-relevant) approach on the other, integrated approach to combine carbon emission and industrial input-output data.  This integrated approach benefits individuals and industries with reasonable carbon emission accounting and reduction regimes that reward values to emission reduction based on data. 

Since the founding of the company in early 2023, Oxford Roadmapping has produced the first Prototype A for the visCEADs during July to December of 2023.

## Showcase of Prototype A<i class="ai ai-pubpeer ai-2x fa-shake"></i>

</div>

The prototype of the visCEADs project showcases one way to extract insights from both the CO2 emission inventory and the input-output table data of 42 industrial sectors and 31 provinces and cities in China.  Conceptually, it combines social network analysis and the 3B framework (backbone, baselines, and benchmarks) to build the core visualization module for  [“dual-carbon management digital platforms”](https://www.isc.org.cn//profile//2023/06/13/60cbc996-47cc-45be-bf0d-06053fbe57de.pdf) or other similar smart digital platforms using similar datasets.

### Progress and Timeline

* 2023/04：Preparation: Brief research report ["Smart digital platforms for carbon neutral management and services"](https://oxon8.netlify.app/post/2023-02-20-smart-digital-platforms-carbon-neutral-management-services/) was accepted and indexed after peer-review.  It visualized key elements of digital platforms of / for GHG emission reduction and their enabling mechanisms, which support various platform business model opportunities. 

* 2023/05：Launch: Science-mapping and market research was conducted to explore data sources and market demands, including Chinese examples of [Software as a Service (SaaS) for enterprise carbon inventory management ](https://www.skyco2.com/ncem/index.html), [GHG emission auditing standard database](https://www.skyco2.com/）, etc.

* 2023/07：Project Requirements Document: Successful identification of key data, standard, and market demand resources, including China's [“Dual-Carbon Management Digital Platform”](https://www.isc.org.cn//profile//2023/06/13/60cbc996-47cc-45be-bf0d-06053fbe57de.pdf) industry standard led by the Internet Society of China, and various international patent applications and scientific findings provide basis for technology roadmapping.  Such technology roadmapping led to the establishment of  "3B" frameworks: backbone, baseline, and benchmark, which describes the approach that integrates data science and industrial ecology knowledge for producing decarbonization intelligence：

    * Backbone (of the core network of industrial input-output relationships ):

Based on the historical and latest input-output table data, the network visualization can help industrial and local government organizations to manage the risks of industrial reconstruction for decarbonization. Data-driven transformation strategies can be made based on the backbone of industrial structure, preventing major risks such as "out-of-touch" actions that are unviable, misguided pathways that do not face the reality, and misidentified foci for decarbonization efforts. 

    * Baseline (of the situated regional and sectorial contexts and comparisons):

Based on the CEADs insight, especially the CO2 emission data and various derived carbon intensity indicators, baseline data can be produced across provinces and sectors as a whole or as a group.  Such data processing outcomes provide baseline indicators for viable journey roadmapping for "precision decarbonization" based on the situational intelligence of the province and/or the sector in question, thereby providing the design of both generalized and custom-made Key Performance Indicators (KPI).  Altogether, these baseline indicators and their designs and methods, provide the evaluative framework of dual carbon (carbon peak and carbon neutral) smart digital platforms that consider industrial and regional differences and characteristics based on data science.  The evaluative framework can be then used to produce product requirement and standardization documents.
