### [Oxford Roadmapping](https://oxon8.com/) Data Scientist

Han-Teng Liao works across disciplines to contribute to the better managing by data-driven design for climate and sustainable development challenges, inspired by [managing by design](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5626&context=lkcsb_research).  His journey across disciplines and with the open source software, open content, open data, open science, and open innovations around the world has strengthened his belief that evidence-based policies can make a difference through the divergent and convergent thinking processes of problem-solving and story-telling. 
## Biography

Han-Teng Liao (IEEE member; DPhil. Oxon.) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1976. He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering ([NTUEE](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/about1.php)) and a bachelor's degree in foreign languages and literature from National Taiwan University in 2000. He received a master's degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering ([NTUCSIE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/)) and a master's degree in Journalism ([NTUJournalism](http://www.journalism.ntu.edu.tw/Journalism/Default.html))
from the same university in 2004. After working in open source and open content movement in Taiwan, he pursued and received a DPhil. (Ph.D.) degree (Oxford Internet Institute, [OII](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/han-teng-liao)) from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom in Information, Communication and Social Sciences.

After serving as a project manager for the open source software platform Open Source Software Foundry at the Information Science Institute of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan, and then as a battalion-level political warfare officer and acting company commander (Taiwan compulsory military service), he received a diploma from Oxford University in the United Kingdom in 2014 **Ph.D. in Information, Communication and Social Sciences. The doctoral thesis examines the governance and performance of **open collaboration** across different national, regional and linguistic borders.

Postdoctoral work mainly focuses on evidence-based policy research. From 2015 to 2016, he was the first researcher at the United Nations University Institute for Computing and Society (UNU-CS). Before that, he also served as a Yahoo researcher at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, DC, and a researcher at the School of Foreign Service in Berlin, Germany. Summer fellows at the **Alexander von Humboldt University** Institute for Internet and Society do think tank-type research related to the Internet. Since 2017, he has been an associate professor at Guangzhou Southern College (formerly Sun Yat-sen University Southern College).

His current research interests include green digital transformation, artificial intelligence for good, technology for good, carbon neutrality, socio-technical transformation, sustainable supply chains and foresight/speculative design of future technologies.

He serves as the Director of the Higher Education Impact Assessment Center (also known as _GDT for Green Digital Transformation_) and has been advancing innovative teaching and research on sustainable development through cloud-based, API-based artificial intelligence project management and product design courses and workshops .

He served as the conference chairman of the 2019 World Ecological Design Conference: Sustainable Development Innovation Design and Internet Ecology held in Conghua, Guangzhou, China, and edited the report titled "**Internet Ecological Design for Good**". He served as the conference organizer of the 2011 China Internet Research Conference (**Chinese Factors in Internet Development: Global Public Goods, National Policies, and Private Interests**) held in Washington, DC, USA.

He continues to work in the field of artificial intelligence for good and technology for good, including working with team members of Guangzhou Nanfang University's school-level GDT Green and Digital Transformation and ESG Data-Driven Decision Lab to carry out interdisciplinary work in the field of green digital transformation. Work.

He recently received a Certificate of Merit at the 2021 IEEE TEMSMET Conference in recognition of his leadership in research efforts on **CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)** and **ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) Reporting**. He is a member of IEEE TEMS and the university's IEEE student chapter advisor.

The purpose of his current research on social services is to promote industry-university cooperation in ecological design and business ecosystems, especially on how platforms such as cloud computing (such as software as a service), artificial intelligence (AI) and big data can use monitoring, analysis, Evaluate and design key indicators to promote sustainable development goals (mainly climate goals related to carbon neutrality). These measurement indicators need to be defined and concreted through the "feasible consensus mechanism" method to define and specify emerging future technologies and how to integrate, Applied in an auditable and responsible manner, it produces positive socio-economic and environmental impacts.
