Making carbon pollution visible, so that the roadmap forwards can be clear.

The interactive infographics, developed by Oxford Roadmapping, have been released , both in [Chinese](https://oxfordroadmap.github.io/vis-carbon/index.zh-hans.html) and [English](https://oxfordroadmap.github.io/vis-carbon/index.en.html)
versions, based on the [Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets（CEADs）](https://www.ceads.net.cn/).

For <span class="highlight-container highlight-green"><span class="highlight">green</span></span> and <span class="highlight-container highlight-yellow"><span class="highlight">digital</span></span> **transformation** 
("twin transition") development, Oxford Roadmapping contributes to the use-case study, scenario forecasting, standardization, governance thinking for designing the next-generation digital solutions.

### Using Intergraphics

The "vis-carbon" project has  [Chinese](https://oxfordroadmap.github.io/vis-carbon/index.zh-hans.html) and [English](https://oxfordroadmap.github.io/vis-carbon/index.en.html)
versions, both of which are interactive. 

Links represent the cash flows (in and out, directional) among the industrial sectors.  Nodes represent the amount of total production, along with other attributes shown in hovering, including carbon emission and carbon intensity.  

1. Pick a province

2. Pick a year

3. Click "Load"


Explore the network structure and ins and outs, along with the carbon emission and intensity data from the CEADs.

The "vis-carbon" project for Chinese provinces (α-version), based on the [Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets（CEADs）](https://www.ceads.net.cn/), to explore the roadmaps for their reduction of carbon emission and pollution in terms of industrial inputs and outputs.  It is developed by Chief Data Scientst at Oxford Roadmapping.
